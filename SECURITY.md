# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of the Dockerfile Generator project seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability within this project, please report it to us as soon as possible.

**Please do NOT open a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.**

### When Reporting, Please Include:

- A clear and concise description of the vulnerability.
- Steps to reproduce the vulnerability.
- The version(s) of the project affected.
- Any potential impact of the vulnerability.
- If possible, a proposed fix or mitigation.

We will acknowledge your report within 2-3 business days and aim to provide a full response within 10 business days, depending on the complexity of the issue.

## Responsible Disclosure

We appreciate responsible disclosure of vulnerabilities. We kindly request that you:

- Do not publicly disclose the vulnerability until we have had a reasonable time to address it.
- Do not access or modify data without explicit permission.
- Do not impact the availability or performance of services.

Thank you for helping to keep this project secure!
